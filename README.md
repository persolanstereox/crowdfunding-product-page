## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

That was my first usecase of local storage nad variables in sass. I also made smooth scrolling by myself for a first time and use Internalization API for number formatting.

### Continued development

I want to focus on learning JavaScript and make some project using OOP and advances DOM events
